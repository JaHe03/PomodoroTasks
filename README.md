# PomodoroTasks
 A simple personal Pomodoro Website that I have been building. 

 What is Pomodoro?
 A—The Pomodoro technique is a time management method in which you set a specific amount of time to work on a task. After the time is up, you take a short break! You repeat this process for several cycles, followed by a longer break.

I plan to add more features in the future.
